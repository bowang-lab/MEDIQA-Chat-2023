Referring Physician: Dr. Henry Howard

Chief Complaint: Worsening headaches over the past few months

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Ward presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, with worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. His past clinical history is unremarkable. Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where a pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, UH, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

Physical Examination:
The patient is alert, oriented to time, place, and person. Affect is appropriate and speech is fluent. Cranial nerve examination is grossly intact. No focal, motor, or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities. Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.
