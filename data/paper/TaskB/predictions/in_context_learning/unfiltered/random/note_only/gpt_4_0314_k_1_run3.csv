Non-healing diabetic foot ulcer on right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas is a patient with a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy who presents with a non-healing foot ulcer on his right foot. The patient first noticed the ulcer approximately six weeks ago after wearing tight shoes. The initial blister has since become unroofed with thick, soft, and mushy skin underneath, accompanied by a foul smell and yellow drainage. The patient's primary care physician started him on antibiotics six days ago. The patient has experienced some fever and chills but no nausea or vomiting. The wound has turned black around the edges, and the patient has been experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. There is also a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot.

The patient's blood sugars have been trending higher in the past few weeks, with some readings in the 300-400 range and one spike at 500-600. The patient has an A1C of 6.7 and has been well-controlled for the past two years.
