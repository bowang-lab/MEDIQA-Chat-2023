Chest pain and difficulty swallowing.

Betty Hill, a 52-year-old female, presents with a history of chest pain and difficulty swallowing that occurred in early October 2020. The patient reports that the chest pain lasted for four days and was located in the center of her chest, behind her breastbone. The pain was sharp and felt worse with eating. She also experienced difficulty swallowing during this time. The patient visited the ER, where they performed an EKG and blood tests, which were normal. The ER suspected a GI issue and referred her to our clinic. Since then, the patient's symptoms have resolved, and she has not experienced any additional episodes of chest pain or difficulty swallowing.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Uterine fibroids, anemia, and gallbladder removal.

Abdomen
- Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

Possible etiologies include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. The patient's history suggests that her symptoms may have been related to an anxiety attack due to a job transition, with possible contributions from musculoskeletal etiologies.

PLAN

- Discussed the option of performing an EGD (upper endoscopy) to evaluate the esophagus and stomach for possible esophagitis. However, since the patient has been asymptomatic for three months, it is likely that any esophagitis would have healed by now, and the EGD may not reveal any significant findings.

- Follow up as needed for any other GI complaints.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will contact the office if she experiences any additional episodes of pain or other concerning symptoms. If necessary, we will schedule an EGD to further evaluate her condition."
