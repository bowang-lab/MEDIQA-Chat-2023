Right index finger pain and swelling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male presenting today for a second opinion regarding his right index finger injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The patient reports that he was a passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended, causing him to stretch out his right index finger. He has been experiencing pain and swelling in the finger since the accident and has difficulty making a fist. The pain is exacerbated by driving. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics and has undergone physical therapy and an MRI.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

Allergies
Methylprednisolone causes itching.
Dexamethasone causes palpitations.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Employed as an x-ray technician.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain and swelling.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10-degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Mr. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male presenting today for a second opinion of his right index finger injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that he is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

Occupational therapy as prescribed."

Recurrent lung infections.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patient reports having multiple lower respiratory infections in the past six months, occurring approximately every month or every other month. Symptoms include coughing, mucus production, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever. Patient has been treated with antibiotics and has visited urgent care and the emergency room for these issues. Symptoms typically last from a couple of days to a week. Patient is a farmer and has recently been unloading hay more frequently, which seems to coincide with the onset of symptoms.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient is a farmer and has been helping his brother with unloading hay. He denies smoking or living with anyone who smokes. Patient has ten siblings.

ALLERGIES

Patient denies history of seasonal allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fever.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath and productive cough.

VITALS

Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute.
Pulse oxygenation: 99 percent on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Some fine rales were noted.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No clubbing.

RESULTS

X-ray of the chest was reviewed today and shows some round glass opacities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Recurrent lung infections.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

Russell is a patient who has been experiencing sharp pain on the right side of his abdomen below his ribs for the last several days. The pain moves to his lower abdomen and into his groin. The pain is intermittent and severe, making it difficult for him to find a comfortable position. He reports a burning sensation during urination and dark-colored urine. He has taken Tylenol for the pain, but it has not provided relief. The patient feels nauseated but has not vomited. He has a family history of kidney stones and has had them before, but this episode is taking longer to resolve.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Abdomen
• No tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding, no peritoneal signs.
• Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

CT scan of the abdomen shows a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis (kidney stone)
   • Medical Treatment: Recommend the patient to push fluids to facilitate urination and help pass the stone. Prescribe oxycodone 5 mg every 6-8 hours as needed for pain, and continue alternating with Tylenol. Provide a strainer for the patient to strain urine and collect the stone for testing.
   • Diagnostic Tests: Order a basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture.
   • Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks. If symptoms persist, discuss further treatment options such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."
