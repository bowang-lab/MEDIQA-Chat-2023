Worsening headaches and newly diagnosed pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for consultation regarding a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. He was referred by Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention. Mr. Ward initially presented to his primary care provider on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denies any past history of headaches. His past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size, and no other abnormalities are noted.

The patient reports headaches located behind his eyes, described as a dull nagging ache, with a severity of 6/10. The headaches began three months ago and have gradually worsened over time. They tend to be worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or passing out. He has recently noticed bumping into door frames.

RESULTS

MRI brain with contrast (3/4/21): Pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm.

ASSESSMENT

• Pituitary adenoma.

PLAN

1. Recommend surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa due to symptomatic optic chiasmal compression.
2. Refer the patient to the eye doctor for a full exam and visual field test to assess peripheral vision before and after surgery.

Betty Hill is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia. She presents as a new patient with a referral from the ER for esophagitis. The patient experienced chest pain for four days in early October 2020, which resolved on its own. She visited the ER during that time, where they performed an EKG and blood tests, all of which were normal. The patient reports difficulty swallowing during the episode, which also resolved. She denies any recent heartburn or indigestion. The pain was worse with eating. She has no known family history of GI problems and had her gallbladder removed several years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Abdomen
• Lower Abdomen: No pain or tenderness upon palpation.
• Upper Abdomen: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presents with a history of chest pain and difficulty swallowing in October 2020. The ER ruled out heart issues, and other potential causes could be anxiety, esophagitis, or intense heartburn. The patient mentioned a stressful job transition during that time, which could have contributed to her symptoms.

Given the patient's current asymptomatic status, the plan is to hold off on an EGD and monitor for any additional symptoms. The patient will call the office if any additional episodes of pain or other concerning symptoms occur. If needed, an EGD will be scheduled. The patient will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints.

Possible etiologies include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. The suspected cause is an anxiety attack related to her job transition, with possible contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies."

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Russell is a pleasant patient who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. He has been experiencing sharp pain on the right side of his abdomen below his ribs for the last several days. The pain radiates to his lower abdomen and into his groin. The pain is intermittent and severe. He reports burning sensation during urination and dark-colored urine. He has taken Tylenol for the pain, but it has not been effective. The patient has a history of kidney stones and has been able to pass them in the past. His father also had kidney stones.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Abdominal: Sharp pain on the right side of the abdomen, radiating to lower abdomen and groin.
Urinary: Burning sensation during urination, dark-colored urine.

VITALS

Not provided.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Abdomen: No tenderness to palpation, no evidence of rebound or guarding, no peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient will be given a strainer to use when urinating to catch the stone when it passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. The patient is advised to contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."
