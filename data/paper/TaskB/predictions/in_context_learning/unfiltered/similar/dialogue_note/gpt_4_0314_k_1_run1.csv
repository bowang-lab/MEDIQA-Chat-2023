Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for consultation regarding a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. He initially presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Henry Howard, on 3/1/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. His past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal. MRI for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

Betty Hill, a 53-year-old female, presents with a referral from the ER for esophagitis. She experienced chest pain for four days in early October 2020, which resolved on its own. The patient visited the ER during that time, where they performed an EKG and blood tests, both of which were normal. The pain was located in the center of her chest, behind her breastbone, and was sharp in nature. The patient reports difficulty swallowing during the episode, which has also resolved since then. She denies any family history of GI problems and has had her gallbladder removed several years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Abdomen
• Lower abdomen: No pain or tenderness upon palpation.
• Upper abdomen: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 53-year-old female who presents with a history of chest pain and difficulty swallowing, which resolved on its own. The ER ruled out heart issues with an EKG and blood tests. Possible etiologies for her symptoms include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. The patient mentioned a stressful job transition around the time of the episode, which could have contributed to her symptoms.

Given that the patient has been asymptomatic for three months, the plan is to hold off on an EGD and monitor for any additional symptoms. The patient has elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change. She will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints."

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Russell is a pleasant patient who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began several days ago on the right side of his abdomen below his ribs. The pain radiates to his lower abdomen and into his groin. The pain is intermittent and severe. The patient reports burning sensation during urination and dark-colored urine. He has taken Tylenol for pain relief, but it has not been effective. The patient has a history of kidney stones and reports that his father also had them.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Abdominal: Reports sharp pain on the right side of the abdomen, radiating to the lower abdomen and groin.

Urinary: Reports burning sensation during urination and dark-colored urine.

VITALS

Not provided.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Abdomen: No tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding, no peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient will be given a strainer to use when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy and ureteroscopy. The patient is advised to contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."
