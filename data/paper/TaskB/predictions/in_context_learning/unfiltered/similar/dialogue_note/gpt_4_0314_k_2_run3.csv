Worsening headaches and pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. The patient was referred by Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention. Mr. Ward initially presented to Dr. Howard on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months, which he had not experienced before. His past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size, and no other abnormalities are noted.

PAST HISTORY

Unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Occupation: Computer programmer.
Marital status: Married for 25 years.
Recently bought a small house.
Adopted, unknown family medical history.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Tylenol (tried for headaches, but discontinued due to lack of efficacy).

RESULTS

MRI of the brain with contrast (3/4/21): Pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm.

ASSESSMENT

• Pituitary adenoma.

PLAN

1. Recommend surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa due to symptomatic clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression.
2. Refer the patient to an eye doctor for a full exam and visual field test to assess peripheral vision before and after surgery.
3. Schedule surgery with the surgery scheduler, Deborah.
4. Encourage the patient to call if they have any questions or concerns.

The patient is informed of the risks associated with anesthesia and surgery, including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or even death. The patient understands the risks and agrees to proceed with the surgery."

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is concerning and will require further intervention. I will order a test to check blood supply for this wound. I will perform a debridement today in the office and obtain a culture to guide antibiotic therapy. The patient will continue his current antibiotics, and we may adjust or add antibiotics based on the culture results. I want the patient to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure proper diabetes management. I will see the patient again in seven days to monitor the progress of the wound and address any additional concerns."
