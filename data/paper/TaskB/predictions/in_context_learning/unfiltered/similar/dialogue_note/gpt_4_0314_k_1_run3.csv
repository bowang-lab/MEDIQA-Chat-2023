Mr. Ward initially presented to his primary care provider on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denies any history of headaches. His past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Pertinent labs and radiology studies were reviewed, including a pituitary hormone profile demonstrating a low TSH, with all other results normal.

Abdomen
• Lower Abdomen: No pain or tenderness.

Given the patient's lack of symptoms for the past three months, we discussed the option of performing an EGD or upper endoscopy to evaluate her esophagus and stomach. However, the patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any recurrence or change. She will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports having the ulcer for about six weeks, which he first noticed after wearing a pair of tight shoes. The ulcer started as a blister and progressed to an unroofed wound with thick, soft, mushy skin and yellow drainage. He has been experiencing a foul smell from the wound and has had a fever of 99.7°F and chills. He started antibiotics six days ago, but the wound has turned black around the edges and he has been experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. He also reports a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot.

He is a diabetic with a history of diabetic neuropathy. His blood sugars have been trending in the 300-400 range for the past two weeks, with one spike at 500-600. His last A1C was 6.7.
