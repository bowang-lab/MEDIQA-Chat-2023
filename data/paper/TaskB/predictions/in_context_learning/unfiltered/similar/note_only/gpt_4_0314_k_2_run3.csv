Pituitary hormone profile demonstrated a low TSH, with all other results being normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 revealed a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. No other abnormalities were noted.

The patient reports headaches located behind his eyes, described as a dull nagging ache, with a gradual onset and worsening over the past three months. The headaches are worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. No other symptoms, such as fever, neck stiffness, numbness, or weakness, were reported.

Betty Hill is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia. She presents as a new patient with a referral from the ER for esophagitis. The patient experienced chest pain in early October 2020, which lasted for four days. The pain was located in the center of her chest, behind her breastbone, and was sharp in nature. She also had difficulty swallowing during this time. The patient visited the ER, where she underwent an EKG and blood tests, both of which were normal. She has not had any chest pain since then. The patient has a history of gallbladder removal surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Abdomen
• Examination of Abdomen: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants. No pain or tenderness in the lower belly.

RESULTS

EKG and blood tests from the ER visit were normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 53-year-old female who presents with a history of chest pain and difficulty swallowing, which resolved after four days in October 2020. The ER ruled out heart issues with an EKG and blood tests. Possible etiologies include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. The patient experienced a stressful job transition around the time of the chest pain, which may have contributed to her symptoms.

The patient and doctor discussed the option of an EGD to investigate esophagitis, but given the lack of symptoms for the past three months, they decided to hold off on the procedure. The patient will self-monitor her symptoms and call the office if any additional episodes of pain or other concerning symptoms occur. If necessary, an EGD will be scheduled at that time. The patient will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints."
