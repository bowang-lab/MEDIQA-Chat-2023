He has experienced fever, chills, and worsening pain in the foot. The area around the wound has turned black, and he has developed cramping in his calf muscle. He also reports a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot. The patient has noticed increased coughing and difficulty catching his breath in the last two days.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a history of diabetes with a well-controlled hemoglobin A1c of 6.7. He has been experiencing elevated blood sugars in the range of 300-400 in the last two weeks, with one spike at 500-600.
