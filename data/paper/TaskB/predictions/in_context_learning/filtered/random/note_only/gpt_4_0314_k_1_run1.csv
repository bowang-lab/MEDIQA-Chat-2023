Abdomen
• Examination of Abdomen: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants. No pain or tenderness in the lower abdomen.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of uterine fibroids, anemia, and gallbladder removal. She presents with a referral for esophagitis following an episode of chest pain and difficulty swallowing in October 2020. Cardiac issues were ruled out in the ER.

Given the patient's stressful job transition at the time of the episode, it is suspected that she may have experienced an anxiety attack, with possible contributions from musculoskeletal etiologies. The patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change. An EGD was discussed but deferred due to the patient being asymptomatic for an extended period. The patient will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints."
