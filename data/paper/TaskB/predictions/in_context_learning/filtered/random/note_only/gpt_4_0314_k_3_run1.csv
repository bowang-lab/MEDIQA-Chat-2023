Non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas is a patient with a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy who presents with a non-healing foot ulcer on his right foot. The patient first noticed the ulcer approximately six weeks ago after wearing tight shoes. The initial blister has progressed to an unroofed wound with thick, soft, mushy skin, foul smell, and yellow drainage. The patient has been on antibiotics for six days, and while initially improving, the wound has now developed blackened edges and the patient is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. There is also a red streak extending up the front part of the ankle and along the inside portion of the calf muscle, which is hot to touch. The patient has had a fever of 99.7°F and chills. Blood sugars have been elevated in the past few weeks, with a recent A1C of 6.7%.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Fever and chills.
• Respiratory: Cough and shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Cramping in the calf muscle.
• Integumentary: Non-healing foot ulcer with foul smell and yellow drainage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Vitals: Slight fever, otherwise stable.
• Foot Exam: Necrotic wound on the right heel, approximately 2x2 cm, sloughing tissue, cellulitis, erythema, and foul odor. No bony exposure.
• Vascular Exam: Bilateral palpable femoral and popliteal pulses. Non-palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, but present via Doppler.

RESULTS

Right foot x-ray: No evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with a non-healing foot ulcer, likely related to diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. The wound has progressed despite antibiotic therapy, and there is concern for cellulitis and potential infection.
• Additional Testing: Order a test to check blood supply for the wound. Obtain a culture of the wound.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current antibiotic therapy, pending culture results. Perform debridement in the office today. Monitor the redness and swelling in the calf closely. Follow up in 7 days.

Diabetes management.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient's blood sugars have been elevated recently, and it is important to maintain tight glycemic control to promote wound healing.
• Medical Treatment: Encourage the patient to follow up with their endocrinologist and continue monitoring blood sugars closely.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

RESULTS

Lyme titer and Western blot tests pending.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite and possible Lyme disease.
   - Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with a tick bite on the right knee and a bull's-eye rash, which raises concern for Lyme disease.
