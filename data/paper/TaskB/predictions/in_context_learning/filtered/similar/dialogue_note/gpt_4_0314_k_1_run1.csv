PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is concerning and will require further evaluation and treatment. I will order a test to check blood supply for this wound. I will perform a debridement today in the office and obtain a culture to guide antibiotic therapy. We will continue the current antibiotics and reevaluate based on culture results. I want the patient to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure continued control of his diabetes. I will see the patient again in seven days to monitor his progress."
