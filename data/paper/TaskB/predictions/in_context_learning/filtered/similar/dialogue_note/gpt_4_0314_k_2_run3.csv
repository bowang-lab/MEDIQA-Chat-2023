Russell is a pleasant patient who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. He has been experiencing sharp pain on the right side of his abdomen below his ribs for the last several days. The pain radiates to his lower abdomen and into his groin. The pain is intermittent and worsens when it occurs. He reports burning sensation during urination and darker urine at times. He has taken Tylenol for pain relief, but it has not been effective.

Not provided.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Abdomen: No tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding, no peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. The patient should contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."
