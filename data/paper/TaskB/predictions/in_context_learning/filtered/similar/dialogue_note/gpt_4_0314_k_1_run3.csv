Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for consultation regarding a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. The patient initially presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Henry Howard, on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months.

Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size, and no other abnormalities are noted.

The patient describes the headaches as a dull, nagging ache located behind his eyes, with a severity of 6 out of 10. The headaches have been gradually worsening over the past three months and tend to be worse in the morning. They last for a few hours at a time, and nothing seems to make them better or worse.

Abdomen: No tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding, no peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient will be provided with a strainer to use when urinating to catch the stone for further testing. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. The patient is advised to contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."
