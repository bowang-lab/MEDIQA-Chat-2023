PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should push fluids to help facilitate urination and passing the stone. I have provided a strainer for the patient to use when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. The patient should contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."

Right foot non-healing ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot non-healing ulcer. He reports having the ulcer for about six weeks, which started as a blister after wearing tight shoes. The blister became unroofed, revealing thick, soft, mushy skin with a foul smell and yellow drainage. The patient's wife called their primary care doctor, who started the patient on antibiotics six days ago. The patient has experienced a fever of 99.7 and chills. The ulcer has turned black around the outside, and the patient has been experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. There is a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is hot to touch. The patient has also been experiencing coughing and difficulty catching his breath.

The patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. His blood sugars have been running high, in the 300-400 range, with one spike at 500-600. His last A1C was 6.7.
