Chief Complaint: Worsening headaches over the past few months

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Ward presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, with worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. His past clinical history is unremarkable. Workup for headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where a pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, UH, coagulation, and CRP, were normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

Physical Examination:
The patient is alert, oriented to time, place, and person. Affect is appropriate and speech is fluent. Cranial nerve examination is grossly intact. No focal, motor, or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities. Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.

Assessment:
Pituitary adenoma

Plan:
1. Refer the patient to an eye doctor for a full exam and visual field test to map peripheral vision prior to surgery.
2. Schedule transsphenoidal surgery to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa.
3. Monitor patient's vision and headache symptoms post-surgery.

Summary:
Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign-appearing pituitary adenoma, incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches. He is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, therefore surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated."

Chief Complaint: Chest pain (resolved)

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Hill is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of uterine fibroids, anemia, and gallbladder removal. She presents today with a referral from the ER for esophagitis. She reports having chest pain for four days in early October 2020, which has since resolved. The pain was located in the center of her chest, behind her breastbone, and was sharp in nature. The pain was worse with eating and she experienced difficulty swallowing during that time. She denies any current chest pain or swallowing difficulty. She has no recent history of heartburn or indigestion. ER workup, including EKG and blood tests, was normal.

Past Medical History:
- Uterine fibroids
- Anemia
- Gallbladder removal

Physical Exam:
- Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants
- No pain or tenderness in the lower abdomen
- Overall normal exam

Assessment:
Ms. Hill's history suggests possible etiologies for her chest pain, including GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal causes, and anxiety. It is suspected that she may have had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, with possible contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

Plan:
1. Discussed the option of EGD vs. monitoring for symptoms. The patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any recurrence or change.
2. Encourage the patient to follow up as needed for any other GI complaints.
3. Continue to monitor weight loss efforts and overall health.
