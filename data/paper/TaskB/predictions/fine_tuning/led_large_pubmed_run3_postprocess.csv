 Neck - General Examination: No lymph lymphadenopathy. No swollen lymph glands. Cardiovascular - Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. Musculoskeletal - Examination: Abdomen is soft. No tenderness as I push around. 

RESULTS

 The patient's most recent lab work was reviewed and it is consistent with an iga deficiency. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

 1. Abnormal labs. - Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms similar to an immunodeficiency. His recent labwork was also consistent with a deficiency of iga. - Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of the diagnosis and that this is common to many people with this type of immunosuppression. I advised the patient that his body makes many different types of antibodies and that his Ziga deficiency is a little lower than normal most of the time of his entire life. I also advised him that even without knowing that he has a deficiency, he should continue to function perfectly normal. Questions were invited and answered today. - medical Treatment: We are going to order additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies. Bring the patient in for that. The only other thing I would recommend is that if he eats and ends up needing blood products between now and when I see him next, that he tell them that he have a history of a iga deficient. Patient Agreements: the patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

He started me on some antibiotics about 6 days ago and I never had any nausea or vomiting. At one point he had to put on an extra blanket in bed because he had chills. When he started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good, but we have now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and he is getting some cramping in his calf muscle. There was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscles. It is super super hot. He has noticed that every time he pushes that, he feels it all the way up to his knee behind his kneecap. He also noticed that he has been coughing a lot the last 2 days.
