He should continue to alternate with Tylena. I will also prescribe a strainer that he can strain his urine so that we can see the stone when it passes. If his symptoms do not improve over the next week, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate him and use shock waves to break up the stone and help it pass. We could also do a ureTERoscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureters to retrieve the stone.
