 After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his blood sugar levels have been fluctuating over the last 3 to 4 weeks and that his A1c has been 6 to 7. We discussed that his sugars may have been as high as 5 to 6 hundreds at times during that time and that this may be what caused his wife to call the primary care physician. I has recommended that the patient continue his antibiotics therapy. We will order a test to check blood supply for the wound, and we will also perform a debridement today in the office. We may have to look at a culture and other antibiotic therapy as well. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up the leg as wellas the swelling and pain that he have in his calves. He will follow up with his endocrinologist to make sure that he is keeping his hemoglobin a1c below 7. Since we are going to be doing medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications, any other questions or concerns have been answered."
