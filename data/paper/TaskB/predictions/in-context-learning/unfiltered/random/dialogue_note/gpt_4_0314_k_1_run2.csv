Mr. Ward presented to his primary care provider on 3/1/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. His past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where a pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, UH, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.

Mr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.

In addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Abdomen
Normoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.

RESULTS

CT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.
Impression: Normal CT of abdomen.

ASSESSMENT

• Constipation
• Mild hepatomegaly

PLAN

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.

Constipation
• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.
• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.

Mild Hepatomegaly
• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.
• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.
• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.
• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.
