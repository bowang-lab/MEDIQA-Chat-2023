HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Russell Johnson is a 62-year-old male who presents with sharp pain on the right side of his abdomen below his ribs for the last several days. The pain feels like it goes to his lower abdomen and into his groin. The pain comes and goes, and when it comes, it is severe. The patient reports a burning sensation during urination and dark-colored urine. He has taken Tylenol for the pain, but it has not provided relief. He feels nauseated but has not vomited. The patient has a history of kidney stones, and his father also had kidney stones.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Abdominal: No tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding, no peritoneal signs.
• Flank: Positive CVA tenderness on the right side.

RESULTS

• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, burning sensation during urination, and a history of kidney stones. The CT scan confirms the presence of a kidney stone in the proximal right ureter.
• Medical Treatment: Recommend the patient to push fluids to facilitate urination and help pass the stone. Prescribe oxycodone 5 mg every 6-8 hours as needed for pain, and continue alternating with Tylenol. Provide a strainer for the patient to strain urine and collect the stone when it passes.
• Additional Testing: Order a basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture.
• Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks. If the patient is still having symptoms, discuss further treatment options such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy.
