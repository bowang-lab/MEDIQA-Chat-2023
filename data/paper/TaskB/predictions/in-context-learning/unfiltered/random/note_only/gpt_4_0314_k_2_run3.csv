ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Nicholas is a patient with a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy who presents with a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer on his right foot.

1. Non-healing diabetic foot ulcer:
   • Medical Reasoning: The patient has a necrotic wound with cellulitis and erythema, likely due to tight shoes and uncontrolled blood sugars.
   • Additional Testing: Order a test to check blood supply for the wound.
   • Medical Treatment: Perform debridement in the office, obtain a culture, and consider different antibiotic therapy based on culture results. Monitor the redness and swelling in the calf closely. Follow up in 7 days.
   
2. Diabetes management:
   • Medical Reasoning: The patient's blood sugars have been trending higher recently, and tight glycemic control is essential for wound healing.
   • Specialist Referrals: Follow up with the endocrinologist to ensure continued A1C control below 7.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."
