ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's history and physical exam findings are consistent with a nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer with possible infection.

2. Diabetes management.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's blood sugars have been trending higher recently, and it is important to maintain good glycemic control to promote wound healing.
