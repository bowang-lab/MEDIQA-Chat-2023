He has been on antibiotics for 6 days, with some initial improvement, but now reports the wound has turned black around the edges and he is experiencing calf cramping. He also reports a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is hot to touch. The patient's blood sugars have been trending higher in the past few weeks, with occasional spikes up to 500.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have discussed the current symptoms and plan with the patient. We will order a test to check blood supply for the wound. I will perform a debridement today in the office and obtain a culture to determine if a change in antibiotic therapy is needed. The patient will continue his current antibiotic course, and we will monitor the redness and swelling in his calf closely. I will see the patient again in 7 days for follow-up. In the meantime, the patient is advised to follow up with his endocrinologist to address his recent poor blood sugar control and maintain a hemoglobin A1c below 7."
