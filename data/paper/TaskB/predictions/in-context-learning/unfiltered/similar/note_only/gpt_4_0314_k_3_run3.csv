Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where a pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, UH, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results being normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size, and no other abnormalities are noted.

The patient reports headaches located behind his eyes, described as a dull nagging ache, with a gradual onset and worsening over the past three months. The headaches are worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. The patient denies any other symptoms, such as feeling sick, fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or passing out.
