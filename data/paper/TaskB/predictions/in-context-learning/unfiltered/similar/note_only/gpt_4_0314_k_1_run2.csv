HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic for consultation regarding a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. He initially presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Henry Howard, on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months. The patient denies any history of headaches. His past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for worsening headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, UH, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results being normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size, and no other abnormalities are noted.

The patient describes the headaches as a dull, nagging ache located behind his eyes. The onset was gradual, starting about three months ago, and has worsened over time. The headaches are worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. The patient denies any other symptoms, such as feeling sick, fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or passing out. However, he has noticed recently bumping into door frames.

Betty Hill, a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of uterine fibroids, anemia, and gallbladder removal, presents with a referral from the ER for esophagitis. The patient experienced chest pain for four days in early October 2020, which resolved on its own. She has not had any chest pain since then. The pain was located in the center of her chest, behind the breastbone, and was sharp in nature. The patient reported difficulty swallowing during the episode, which has also resolved. The pain was worse with eating. She denies any recent abdominal pain and reports normal bowel movements. The patient has been trying to lose weight and was going through a stressful job transition at the time of the chest pain episode.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Abdomen
• Examination of Abdomen: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants. No pain or tenderness in the lower abdomen.

RESULTS

ER visit: EKG and blood tests were normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presents with a referral for esophagitis following an episode of chest pain and difficulty swallowing in October 2020. The chest pain and swallowing issues have resolved, and the patient has been asymptomatic for three months. Possible etiologies include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. The patient's job transition stress may have contributed to an anxiety attack, with or without a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

The patient was offered the option of an EGD or upper endoscopy to evaluate her esophagus and stomach, but given the resolution of her symptoms and the time elapsed since the episode, she elected to self-monitor her symptoms and call with any reoccurrence or change. The patient will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints."
