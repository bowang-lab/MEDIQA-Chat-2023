Worsening headaches and pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for consultation regarding a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. The patient was referred by Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention. Mr. Ward initially presented to his primary care provider on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months. He has no history of headaches and his past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, were normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

The patient reports headaches located behind his eyes, described as a dull nagging ache. The onset was gradual, starting about three months ago and worsening over time. The headaches are worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. The patient denies any other symptoms, including fever, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or passing out. However, he has noticed recently that he seems to be bumping into door frames.

Betty Hill, a 52-year-old female, presents for a follow-up after an ER visit for chest pain in early October 2020. The patient experienced chest pain for four days, which resolved after the ER visit. She reports that the pain was located in the center of her chest, behind her breastbone, and felt like a sharp pain. She also experienced difficulty swallowing during the episode, which has since resolved. The patient denies any heartburn or indigestion at the time but is unsure what heartburn feels like. The pain was worse with eating. She has no family history of GI problems and has had her gallbladder removed several years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Abdomen
• Lower abdomen: No pain or tenderness upon palpation.
• Upper abdomen: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presents for follow-up after an ER visit for chest pain. The ER ruled out heart issues with EKG and blood tests. Possible etiologies for her chest pain include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. The patient mentioned a stressful job transition around the time of the episode, which may have contributed to her symptoms.

Given that the patient has been asymptomatic for three months, we discussed the options of performing an EGD or upper endoscopy to evaluate her esophagus and stomach versus monitoring for any additional symptoms. The patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change. She will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints."

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient will be given a strainer to use when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. The patient is advised to contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."

The patient has been on antibiotics for six days, and initially experienced some improvement, but now reports the wound has turned black around the edges and he is experiencing calf cramping. He also reports a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is hot to touch. The patient has a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy, and his blood sugars have been trending higher in the past few weeks.
