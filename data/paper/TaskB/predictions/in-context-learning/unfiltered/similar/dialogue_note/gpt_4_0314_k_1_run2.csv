Worsening headaches and pituitary lesion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for consultation regarding a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. The patient was referred by Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention. Mr. Ward initially presented to Dr. Howard on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any prior history of headaches. His past clinical history is unremarkable.

Workup for headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrated a low TSH, with all other results being normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 revealed a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. No other abnormalities were noted.

The patient reports headaches located behind his eyes, described as a dull nagging ache. The onset was gradual, starting about three months ago and worsening over time. The headaches are worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. The patient denies any other symptoms, such as feeling sick, fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or passing out. However, he has been bumping into door frames recently.

Betty Hill is a 52-year-old female who presents for follow-up after an ER visit for chest pain in October 2020. The patient experienced chest pain for four days, which resolved after her ER visit. She has not had any chest pain since then. The pain was located in the center of her chest, behind her breastbone, and was sharp in nature. The pain was worse with eating and she experienced difficulty swallowing during the episode. The patient has no family history of GI problems and has had her gallbladder removed several years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Abdomen
• Lower Abdomen: No pain or tenderness upon palpation.
• Upper Abdomen: Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presents for follow-up after an ER visit for chest pain. The chest pain has resolved and she has not experienced any additional episodes since October 2020. The ER visit ruled out heart issues and the patient mentioned a stressful job transition during the time of the chest pain episode.

Possible etiologies include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. The current suspicion is that the patient had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, with possible contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

The patient has elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change. An EGD was discussed but deferred due to the patient being asymptomatic for an extended period. The patient will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints."

PHYSICAL EXAM

Abdomen: No tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding, no peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient will be provided with a strainer to use when urinating to catch the stone for further testing. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. The patient is advised to contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."

Nicholas is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer.

He has been on antibiotics for six days, with some initial improvement, but now reports the wound has turned black around the edges and he is experiencing calf cramping. He also notes a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is hot to touch. He has been experiencing some coughing and shortness of breath in the last two days.

He is diabetic with an A1c of 6.7, which has been well-controlled for the past two years. However, his blood sugars have been trending higher in the past two weeks, with some spikes up to 500.
