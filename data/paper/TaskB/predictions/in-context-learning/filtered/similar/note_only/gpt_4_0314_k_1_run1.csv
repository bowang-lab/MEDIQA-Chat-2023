CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 0.5 cm stone located in the proximal right ureter. No evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Acute nephrolithiasis (kidney stone).

PLAN

1. Encourage increased fluid intake to facilitate urination and stone passage.
2. Prescribe oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. Patient may continue to take Tylenol as needed.
3. Provide a strainer for the patient to use when urinating to catch the stone for analysis.
4. Order a basic metabolic panel (BMP), urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.
5. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 1 to 2 weeks to assess progress. If symptoms persist, discuss further treatment options such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy.

INSTRUCTIONS
