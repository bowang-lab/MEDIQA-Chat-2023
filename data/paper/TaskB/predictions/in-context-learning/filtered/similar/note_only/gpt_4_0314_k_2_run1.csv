Non-healing right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas is a patient with a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy who presents today for evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. He reports having the ulcer for approximately 6 weeks, which started as a blister after wearing tight shoes. The patient has been experiencing a foul smell, yellow drainage, and the ulcer has turned black around the edges. He has also been experiencing calf cramping and a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. The patient has been on antibiotics for 6 days and has a few days left in the course. He reports pain in the affected area and difficulty catching his breath when walking around the house.

The patient's blood sugars have been trending in the 300-400 range for the past two weeks, with one spike at 500-600. His last A1c was 6.7.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient enjoys hiking and recently went on a hike with new diabetic shoes.

MEDICATIONS

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fever and chills.

Respiratory: Reports difficulty catching breath when walking around the house.
Skin: Patient reports non-healing right foot ulcer.
Neurological: No reported issues.

VITALS

Slight fever.
Blood pressure: Not provided
Heart rate: Not provided

PHYSICAL EXAM

Foot exam: 2x2 cm necrotic wound on the heel with sloughing tissue, cellulitis, erythemia, and odor. No bony exposure. Non-palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses, but present via Doppler. No pain upon pressing the affected area.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing diabetic foot ulcer
2. Diabetes
3. Diabetic neuropathy

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking his current antibiotics. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his blood sugars have been trending higher than normal. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his endocrinologist for further care."
