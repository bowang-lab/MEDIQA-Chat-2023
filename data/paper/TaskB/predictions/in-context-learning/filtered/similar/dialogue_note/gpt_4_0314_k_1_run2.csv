Workup for headaches was initiated with brain MRI and serology, where the pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size, and no other abnormalities are noted.

The patient reports headaches located behind his eyes, described as a dull nagging ache. The onset was gradual, starting about three months ago, and has worsened over time.

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient will be provided with a strainer to use when urinating to catch the stone when it passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. The patient is advised to contact me if he experiences worsening symptoms."

Non-healing right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. He reports having the ulcer for about six weeks, which he first noticed after wearing a tight pair of shoes. The ulcer started as a blister and has since become unroofed with thick, soft, and mushy skin underneath, accompanied by a foul smell and yellow drainage. He has been on antibiotics for six days, which initially improved his symptoms, but the wound has now turned black around the edges and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. He also reports a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot. He has been experiencing some difficulty catching his breath and coughing for the past two days.

He is diabetic with well-controlled blood sugars (A1c 6.7) but has noticed his blood sugars trending higher in the past two weeks. He has diabetic neuropathy and has been using diabetic shoes and inserts.
