Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes.

Worsening headaches and incidental pituitary lesion discovery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who presents with worsening headaches over the past few months. He denies any history of headaches in the past. The patient was referred by Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention due to the discovery of a pituitary lesion during the workup for his headaches. The patient reports that the headaches are located behind his eyes and describe the pain as a dull, nagging ache. The onset was gradual, starting about three months ago, and has been worsening over time. The headaches are worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. The patient has not noticed any changes in vision or balance but has been bumping into door frames recently.

• Neurological: Cranial nerve examination is grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.
• Ophthalmologic: Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.

RESULTS

MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, coagulation, and CRP, are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, with all other results being normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with worsening headaches and an incidental pituitary lesion discovery.

Pituitary adenoma with optic chiasmal compression.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient has clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression due to a pituitary adenoma.
• Additional Testing: Refer the patient for a visual field test and full eye exam.
• Surgical Treatment: Recommend transsphenoidal surgery to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa. Discuss the risks and benefits of the surgery with the patient.

Headaches.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient's headaches are likely related to the pituitary adenoma and optic chiasmal compression.
• Patient Education and Counseling: Inform the patient that the surgery may help alleviate his headaches.

Emergency room follow-up for chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Roger Nelson is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain. The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and chest pain for approximately an hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished, he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.

The patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.

His blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: Carotid bruit on the right side.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.

RESULTS

Blood pressure is elevated.

EKG is normal.

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.
