Instructions:	Please asses the clinical notes A, B and C relative to the provided doctor-patient dialogue. For each set of notes, you should select which note you prefer ("A", "B", or "C"). If you have approximately equal preference for two notes, select ("A/B", "B/C", or "C/A"). If you have no preference, select "A/B/C". A "good" note should contain all critical, most non-critical and very little irrelevant information mentioned in a dialogue:					
	Critical: Items medico-legally required to document the diagnosis and treatment decisions whose absence or incorrectness may lead to wrong diagnosis and treatment later on, e.g. the symptom "cough" in a suspected chest infection consultation. This is the key information a note needs to capture correctly in order to not mislead clinicians.	Non-critical: Items that should be documented in a complete note but whose absence will not affect future treatment or diagnosis, e.g. "who the patient lives with" in a consultation about chest infection.	Irrelevant: Medically irrelevant information covered in the consultation, e.g. the pet of a patient with a suspected chest infection just died.

[doctor] okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ? [patient] i'm good about it during the week while i am at home working, but on the weekends when i'm out of the house i tend to forget . uh , and so it's not as regimented , but it's been pretty good and-and under control for the most part .

[doctor] okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?

[doctor] so it's a little elevated . your blood pressure's a little elevated here in the office , but you know you could be in some pain , which could make your- [patient] mm-hmm . [doctor] . blood pressure go up . let's look at the readings . [doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings . [doctor] yeah ... yeah you know they do run a little bit on the high side , so we'll have to address that as well . [patient] mm-hmm .

[patient] mm-hmm . [doctor] on your heart exam . which you've had in the past . [patient] mm-hmm . [doctor] so that sounds stable to me . [doctor] on your back exam , you know , you do have some pain to palpation of the lumbar spine . and you have pain with flexion and extension of the back . and you have a negative straight leg raise , which is which is good . so , let's- let's just look at some of your results , okay ?

D2N073	[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . [doctor] hello , how are you ? [patient] i'm good , thank you . [doctor] so tell me what brings you in today . [patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic . [doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ? [patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me . [doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ? [patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess . [doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? [patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old . [doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? [patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly . [doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? [patient] about five to six years ago . [doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? [patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . [doctor] well that's good news . [patient] yeah , i agree . [doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? [patient] no . [doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? [patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year . [doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? [patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . [doctor] all right . and what are you taking ? [patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . [doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? [patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . [doctor] okay . anything else ? [patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff . [doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . [patient] sounds good . thank you . [doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . [patient] okay . [doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . [patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? [doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . [patient] lovely . [doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . [patient] okay . [doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . [patient] all right . [doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . [patient] okay . [doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? [patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards . [doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . [patient] okay . sounds like a plan . [doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . [patient] okay , that sounds great . [doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . [patient] thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . [patient] you too . [doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .

[doctor] worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted . [doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores . [patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you . [doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ? [patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling . [doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ? [patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache . [doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ? [patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .

[doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames . [patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell . [doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery . [patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ? [doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving . [patient] all right . [doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .

CHIEF COMPLAINT  Worsening headaches and incidental pituitary lesion.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Mr. Bruce Ward, a 52-year-old male, presents to the clinic for consultation regarding a newly diagnosed pituitary lesion. He was referred by Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention. Mr. Ward initially presented to his primary care provider on 3/1/21 with complaints of worsening headaches over the past few months. His past clinical history is unremarkable.  Workup for headaches included brain MRI and serology, which incidentally discovered the pituitary lesion. Labs dated 3/3/21, including CBC, UNES, UH, coagulation, and CRP, were all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrated a low TSH, with all other results normal. MRI of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 revealed a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. No other abnormalities were noted.  The patient reports headaches located behind his eyes, described as a dull nagging ache, with a gradual onset and worsening severity over the past three months. The headaches are worse in the morning and last a few hours at a time. No other symptoms were reported, such as fever, neck stiffness, numbness, or weakness.  PAST HISTORY  Medical None  Family Unknown (adopted)  Social Married for 25 years, computer programmer, non-smoker, non-drinker, no recreational drug use.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The patient is alert, oriented to time, place, and person. Affect is appropriate and speech is fluent. Cranial nerve examination is grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities. Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.  RESULTS Imaging  MRI brain with contrast (3/4/21): Pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm.  ASSESSMENT  Pituitary adenoma with optic chiasmal compression.  PLAN  1. Refer the patient to an eye doctor for a full exam and visual field test to assess peripheral vision before surgery. 2. Schedule transsphenoidal surgery for excision and decompression of the pituitary fossa. 3. Counsel the patient on the risks associated with surgery and anesthesia. 4. Monitor the patient's vision post-surgery for improvement.  End of note.	CHIEF COMPLAINT  Pituitary lesion.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.  The patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.  Mr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.  The patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.  PAST HISTORY  Medical Newly diagnosed pituitary lesion.  FAMILY HISTORY  No known family history; adopted.  SOCIAL HISTORY  Employment Status: Works as a computer programmer. Marital Status: Married for 25 years. Living Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house. Alcohol Use: None. Tobacco Use: Non-smoker. Recreational Drugs: None.  PHYSICAL EXAM  Neurological Patient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.  Eyes Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.  RESULTS  Labs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.  Independent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.  ASSESSMENT  • Pituitary adenoma • Bitemporal hemianopia  Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.  PLAN  Pituitary adenoma. We discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.  Bitemporal hemianopia. We will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.  INSTRUCTIONS  • Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing. • Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma. 	CHIEF COMPLAINT   Headache.   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS   Mr. Bruce Ward is a 52-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of worsening headaches. The patient was referred by his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, for possible surgical intervention. Mr. Ward denied any trouble with headaches in the past. He worked as a computer programmer for 25 years. He denies fever, rashes, neck stiffness, numbness, weakness, or tingling. He has never passed out. However, recently, he has been bumping into door frames. The onset of his headaches began about 3 months ago and has progressively worsened over the past few months. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes. They last a few hours at a time and nothing makes them better or worse. He tried Tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did not work, so he stopped. He does not have any other medical problems. His past clinical history is unremarkable.   REVIEW OF SYSTEMS   Musculoskeletal: Denies fever, rash, or numbness. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies neck issues.   VITALS   All eye movements are equal and reactive.   PHYSICAL EXAM   MSK: Examination of the right eye reveals bitemporal hemianopia.   RESULTS   Mri of the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted.   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN   Mr.Bruce Ward isa pleasant 52-years-oldmale who presents today for neuro consult of newly diagnosedpituitary adenoma. He is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitsary fossa is indicated. I personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including Cbc, Unes, coagulation, and crp. All were normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results werenormal. I reviewed pertinent radiology studies including Mri for the brain including contrast from 03/04/21. The images reveal a significant mass in the pituitaries. I have reviewed the images with the patient and he agrees with the diagnosis. We discussed the risks and benefits of surgery. I will refer him to the eye doctor for a full exam and they will perform a visual field test. We will also get him set up today or tomorrow to have the visualField test. He may not be able to see the eye Doctor until after surgery. We also have the pre-surgery visual fieldtest for comparison after surgery, but he should look forward to his headaches going away.   INSTRUCTIONS   The patient will call if he has any questions.	A/B	
D2N075	[doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ? [patient] good morning . yes . that's me . [doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you . [patient] nice to meet you too . [doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ? [patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then . [doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ? [patient] um , early october . [doctor] of 2020 , correct ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ? [patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything . [doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ? [patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp . [doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ? [patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal . [doctor] okay . i see . [patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here . [doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ? [patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like . [doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ? [patient] yes . with eating . [doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ? [patient] mm-hmm . i did . [doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ? [patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong . [doctor] okay . so how has your weight been . [patient] i've been trying to lose weight . [doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ? [patient] uh , no . [doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ? [patient] they're normal . [doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ? [patient] i do n't think so . [doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ? [patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago . [doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you . [patient] okay . [doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ? [patient] yes . it , it hurts a little . [doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ? [patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable . [doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ? [patient] i'd say it's about the same . [doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good . [patient] okay . good . [doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days . [patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened . [doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition . [patient] okay . [doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ? [patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms . [doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk . [patient] no . that's it . thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .	CHIEF COMPLAINT  Esophagitis.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.  The patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.  The patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.  PAST HISTORY  Medical Uterine fibroids. Anemia.  Surgical Cholecystectomy.  FAMILY HISTORY  None reported.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  • Cardiovascular:  Positive for chest pain. • Gastrointestinal:  Positive for difficulty swallowing. • Psychiatric:  Positive for stress.  PHYSICAL EXAM  Gastrointestinal Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.  RESULTS  The patient’s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.  ASSESSMENT  The patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient’s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.  Non-cardiac chest pain.  Suspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.  PLAN  • We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.  INSTRUCTIONS  • Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs. • Follow up as needed.	CHIEF COMPLAINT   Chest pain.   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS   Betty Hill is a new patient with a referral from the emergency room of esophagitis. The patient was referred 3 months ago, but this was her first available appointment. When she called to make the appointment, she was having chest pains, but it stopped after 4 days. The pain was located in the center of her chest, right behind the breastbone, and it felt like she washaving a heart attack. She tolerated the pain for 4 days, but then had to go to the emergency Room because nothing she did relieved the pain. They did a bunch of testing and did not find anything. They thought it was something to do with the gastrointestinal system, so they referred her here. She denies any heartburn or indigestion at the time. She has been trying to lose weight. She does have a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia. Her bowel movements are normal. She is not aware of any family history of gastrointestinal problems. She had a gall bladder out several years ago.   REVIEW OF SYSTEMS   • Cardiovascular: Denies heartburn. • Gastrointestinal: Endorses abdominal pain. • Musculoskeletal: Endorse dyspepsia.   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION   • Respiratory: Mild tenderness in the upper quadrants to light palpation. No pain in the lower quadrants.   RESULTS   Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat - Examination of the upper abdomen is normal. No tenderness is noted in the quadrants of the lower abdomen.   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN   The patient presents today with symptoms similar to esophageal dysphagia. • Medical Reasoning: Given her asymptomatic for 3 months, I suspect an anxiety attack related to her job transition. • Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of monitoring for additional symptoms. Patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change. Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.	CHIEF COMPLAINT  Chest pain and difficulty swallowing in October 2020.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents today for evaluation of chest pain and difficulty swallowing that occurred in October 2020. The patient reports that the chest pain lasted for four days and was located in the center of her chest, behind her breastbone. The pain was sharp and worsened with eating. She also experienced difficulty swallowing during this time. The patient went to the ER, where she had a normal cardiac workup, including EKG and blood tests. The ER suspected a GI issue and referred her to our clinic. The patient's symptoms resolved approximately three days after her ER visit and have not recurred since then.  PAST HISTORY  Medical Uterine fibroids. Anemia. Esophagitis (suspected).  Surgical Cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal).  SOCIAL HISTORY  No significant social history provided.  FAMILY HISTORY  No significant family history of GI problems.  CURRENT MEDICATIONS  None provided.  ALLERGIES  None provided.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  Negative for weight loss, abdominal pain, and bowel movement issues. Positive for chest pain and difficulty swallowing in October 2020, which have since resolved.  PHYSICAL EXAM  Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants. Otherwise, the exam is normal.  ASSESSMENT  Chest pain and difficulty swallowing in October 2020, with possible etiologies including GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal issues, and anxiety. The patient was going through a stressful job transition at the time of the symptoms, which may have contributed to her condition.  PLAN  1. Discussed the option of EGD (upper endoscopy) versus monitoring for symptoms. The patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any recurrence or change. 2. The patient will follow up as needed for any other GI complaints.	A

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Katherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow’s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where “the kidneys fuse into one” and issues with their legs.  The patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates “a lot”. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow’s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.  BIRTH HISTORY  Twin gestation. Birth weight 4 pounds 8 ounces.  PAST HISTORY  Medical Smith-Magenis syndrome.  SOCIAL HISTORY  Patient accompanied to appointment by her mother. Sibling: 9-year-old brother and twin sister.  FAMILY HISTORY  Brother: 9 years old, positive for autism. Twin sister: absence of Smith-Magenis syndrome, no known health conditions. No known family history of genetic conditions, kidney failure, dialysis, or kidney transplant.  PHYSICAL EXAM  Constitutional Well-nourished female, slightly fussy when examined.  Eyes Presences of microphthalmia.  Genitourinary Normal external female genitalia.  Musculoskeletal Extremities: Presence of mild hypotonia of lower extremities and the arms.  ASSESSMENT  • Smith-Magenis syndrome. Katherine is a 22-month-old former 34+3-week-old twin with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Several organ systems can be affected by this chromosomal deletion syndrome and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract have been reported in the literature.  PLAN  We will obtain a kidney ultrasound screening today. If there are abnormalities on the kidney ultrasound, we will determine the next steps and future follow-up. The family lives in Dallas, Georgia, so her follow-up should be at the Town Center location.  INSTRUCTIONS  Complete ultrasound today. I will call patient with results and possible next steps.

a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain [patient] gosh it's like a nine [doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it [patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right [doctor] okay [patient]

[doctor] okay [patient] it's just really along my wrist [doctor] okay any numbness any tingling [patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling [doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright [patient] okay [doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt [patient] yes [doctor] okay [patient] it does [doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well [patient] yeah it does [doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like [patient] not without

bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you [patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all [doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down [patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above

[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] pardon what [patient] a what [doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace [patient] okay thank you [doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay [patient] when do i have to have the surgery [doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform [patient] okay [doctor] alright so what [patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace [doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks [patient] six weeks [doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of [patient] oof [doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions [patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery [doctor] yeah [patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so [doctor] okay how long is the vacation [patient] it's only for like a couple weeks [doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks [patient] no vacation in a month [doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do [patient] that sounds good thank you [doctor] no problem bye [patient] bye [doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present	CHIEF COMPLAINT   Right wrist pain.

VITALS  Blood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg. Heart Rate: 80 beats per minute. Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute. Body Temperature: 97.2 degrees F. HEAD: Normocephalic NECK: No swelling noted CV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities. RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. GI/GU: Non-distended BACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity NECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly. MSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.  RESULTS  X-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.  ASSESSMENT  Right wrist Colles fracture.  PLAN  After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.  In the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.  INSTRUCTIONS  The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress. 	C

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.  The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.  Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.  In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.  MEDICAL HISTORY  Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  SOCIAL HISTORY  Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.  MEDICATIONS  Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,  VITALS  Temperature: 98.2 degrees F Heart rate: 72 bpm Respirations: 16 Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg  PHYSICAL EXAM  MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation. Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.  RESULTS  X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.  ASSESSMENT  1. Left knee pain. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.  PLAN  After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.  Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.  She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.	B	Confidence in the plan in B was preferrable

gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far [patient] that sounds great thank you [doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss [patient] great [doctor] okay any questions for me [patient] i do n't believe so at this time [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit [patient] great thank you

leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up [doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me [patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections [doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual [patient] okay how about any abdominal infections [doctor] diarrhea no [patient] frequently [doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of [patient] okay what about your family

yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes [patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street [doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes [patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that [doctor] i know i know [patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away [doctor] right [patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products [doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally [patient] okay where did you go [doctor] i was in zambia [patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful [doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time [patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial [doctor] no [patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you [doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried [patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea [doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and [patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency [doctor] why is that [patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency [doctor] okay okay thank you [patient] you're welcome [doctor] okay	CHIEF COMPLAINT   Abnormal lab work.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS   Lawrence Diaz is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for an evaluation of right elbow pain, which has been present for approximately 4 days. The patient reports that during this pandemic he really got into ceramics and doing pottery so he has been doing a lot of pottery over the past week. He began to develop elbow pain over the last week. The pain is localized to the inside of his right elbow and does not radiate down his arm or up into his shoulder. He denies any trauma to the arm or elbow. He has tried taking ibuprofen, however, this does not provide him with relief. He rates his pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst pain he has ever felt in his life. He also reports that the pain keeps him up at night. He states that he still tries to work through the pain with using his arm, but it is difficult for him to lift and do things because of the pain.

D2N086	[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that [patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics [patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left [doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now [patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point [doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that [patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled [doctor] okay [patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc [doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park [patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now [doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there [patient] i do n't feel that right there [doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure [patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture [doctor] correct [patient] if i heard [doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy [patient] okay sounds good [doctor] alright	CHIEF COMPLAINT  Non-healing ulcer on his right

ASSESSMENT  Right non-healing diabetic foot ulcer. Diabetes.  PLAN  After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.  In regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7.
