[patient] it hurts like in , in , in the inside of my knee .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] all right . and anything make it better or worse ?
[patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?
[patient] that's right . yeah .
[doctor] okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?
[patient] uh , afib .
[doctor] okay , and are you taking any medications for that ?
[patient] yeah , i am . um , begins with a d.
[doctor] uh , digoxin ?
[patient] that's it . yeah , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i have had a nose job .
[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .
[patient] that hurts a lot .
[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .

[doctor] okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ?
[patient] i'm good about it during the week while i am at home working, but on the weekends when i'm out of the house i tend to forget . uh , and so it's not as regimented , but it's been pretty good and-and under control for the most part .
[doctor] okay , and you're you're taking your medication ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?

[doctor] . blood pressure go up . let's look at the readings .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings .
[doctor] yeah ... yeah you know they do run a little bit on the high side , so we'll have to address that as well .

[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] on your heart exam . which you've had in the past .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so that sounds stable to me .
[doctor] on your back exam , you know , you do have some pain to palpation of the lumbar spine . and you have pain with flexion and extension of the back . and you have a negative straight leg raise , which is which is good . so , let's- let's just look at some of your results , okay ?

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression and prior lobectomy, as well as hypertension. He presents for his annual exam.

The patient reports that he is doing relatively well. Over the summer, he moved his oldest daughter into college which was a little stressful and chaotic in the heat of the summer.

Regarding his depression, he reports that he has been consistent with his Prozac and has not had any incidents in a while.

His hypertension has been slightly uncontrolled. He reports that he is taking his blood pressure at home and it is running high. The patient states that he is pretty regular with his Norvasc during the business week, but on the weekends he will forget to bring it with him.

He reports that he had a prior lobectomy a couple of years ago. He endorses shortness of breath with exertion. The patient has difficulty breathing due to allergies and the heat in the summertime. He also endorses some nasal congestion from the pollen. He reports that he runs in the morning. Occasionally, if it is relatively humid, he will struggle a little bit with breathing and he will feel a little bit of a pounding in his chest. He states that it usually goes away. He reports that he runs 4 to 5 miles a day.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ralph Barnes is a 62-year-old male who presents for his annual examination.

Annual visit.
• Additional Testing: I have ordered his routine blood work and will follow up with the patient via the portal once results are back.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well with his current regimen.
• Medical Treatment: He can continue Prozac 20 mg a day and I provided a refill of that today.

History of lobectomy.
• Medical Reasoning: I do not think we need to do any more work up for this issue. He is able to exercise a lot and his breathing function is back. I do not think he needs to follow up with the surgeon anymore.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well on his current regimen. His blood pressure was normal today and has been trending well over the past several years.
• Additional Testing: I ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate his murmur.
• Medical Treatment: He can continue Norvasc.
